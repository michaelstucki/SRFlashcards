## Usage

From the landing screen, user can create an account, login, or recover their password.
Once logged in, user can delete their account, change their password, or view, create, rename, or delete decks.
User can open a deck to view, add, delete, or edit cards in the deck. Finally, user can drill cards in a deck.

## Flashcard Drills

During a drill session, user is presented with the front side of a card. When the card is clicked, its back side is revealed. User decides whether they got it correct and then presses either *Pass* or *Fail* accordingly. Failed cards are shown again in the session; passed cards are not. A passed card advances to the next Leitner box and its due date is set based on the box in which it resides. A failed card returns to the first box.

## Spaced Repetition

The Leitner boxes are 0-indexed (i.e., the first box has an index of 0, the second an index of 1, etc.) and the cards in a box have due dates set according to a $2^n$ progression, where *n* represents the Leitner box index. So, cards in box 0 are reviewed $2^0$ (1) day after arriving in box 0; cards in box 1 are reviewed $2^1$ (2) days after arriving in box 1, and so on. But each time a card advances to the next Leitner box, before it goes on it first circles back around and retraces its way through the lower boxes back up to the current box before advancing to the next one. If at any point along this journey a card is failed, it returns to the first box and starts its voyage all over again from the beginning.
